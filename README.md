# Brain_methylome_NHP

Raw data and intermediate files are excluded due to the file size (>30TB for the CH methylation) and uploaded in GEO with the accession number of GSE151768 instead. For steps 1 - 7, example files in each folder include first 1000 lines of the original files.

Python/R codes include preprocessing steps and differential methylation analysis.
